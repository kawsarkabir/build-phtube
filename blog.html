        </h1>
        <p>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope.</p>
        <h1 class="text-3xl mt-5">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
        <p>Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. Null means an empty value or a blank value. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.
        </p>
